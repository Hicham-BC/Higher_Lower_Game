# Higher-Lower Game

Welcome to the Higher-Lower Game! This simple Python game lets you compare the follower counts of two randomly selected competitors.

## Game Rules

1. You are presented with two competitors, and you need to guess which one has more followers on a social media platform.  
2. Type 'A' if you think the first competitor has more followers, or 'B' if you think the second one does.  
3. The game will continue with new competitors until you make an incorrect guess.
